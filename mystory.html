<h1>The Girl I said I will MARRY!</h1>
<p>Around october 25, 2020, I saw a girl who stays behind where I stay but she came to visit her sister. One day I saw her at her house and I look her for several times because she is very beautiful girl. It was hard to me to talk with her but one I go there and buy egg while I dont need the egg but I was using that strategy to talk to her. So after I finished buying the egg, I told her I will and pay her a visit after...</p>
<p>I immediately go there and we were talking. And I told her I want to date her but she didnt gave me any specific answer because she was in love with me already. So I became her dating partner. After some weeks, maybe two weeks then I have sex with her. This is how she was dressing before haveing sex...</p><center><img src="IMG_20201109_112709.jpg" width="50%"></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>The girl is Yaa but I dont know how to spell her name because she is a northner ( muslim). I have date more than 20 girls but this girl is the only girl that I like and I love most 100%. Even I become worried if I didnt hear her voice or didnt talk to her.</p>
<p>If I assume, she was 15 or 16 years girls and I was 17 years at that time. I dont know if I could marry the girl or not. My major purpose of loving the girl is, I want her to prove poverty wrong because I hope and believe that her family members including father, mother and brothers and sisters are poor.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Even though if I didnt marry this girl, I will try my best and make God help me to help the girl to be independent and prove poverty wrong and the last thing is Go to heaven!</p>
<p>It is my aim to help many people to be independent...</p>
<p> Even though I said I wanna marry the girl but on 15th december, 2020 when I came back home from my uncle's place, I heard that, the girl is cheating on me so the love I have for 
	increases more because I wanna the girl to be my wife. I asked if what they are saying is true, but she said it is not true but it was true. Even though she was cheating 
	on me but the love I have for her didn't decrease.</p>
	<p> It is my aim to change my girlfriend's life. At that time, if I assumed I was dating three girls including my serious girl Yaa.
